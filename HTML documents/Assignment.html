	<blockquote cite="https://www.campbells.com/v8/v8-energy/">
		V8 Energy® provides steady energy from black and green tea with 80 mg of caffeine, comparable to a cup of coffee.
		It supports focus, offers a combined serving of fruit and veggies, and is packed with B Vitamins and has a good source of Vitamin C.
		With only 50 calories per 8 oz serving and no added sugar, it’s a healthy energy drink you can feel good about.
		Prefer your energy with fizz? 
		Try V8 Sparkling Energy® in refreshing flavors, perfect for a light, fruity pick-me-up!
